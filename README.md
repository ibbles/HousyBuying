# Dependencies

This list was written years after the software itself, so it's mostly guesses.

- Python 2
- matplotlib plotting library. `sudo -H pip install matplotlib`
- Tk GUI widget library. `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
- GTK, I think. Seems lika a dependency for wxPython. `sudo apt-get install gtk+-3.0`
- wxWidgets GUI library.`sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk3.0`
- Python bindings for wxWidget.`sudo -H pip3 install wxPython`
